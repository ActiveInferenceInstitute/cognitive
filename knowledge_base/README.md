# Knowledge Base Overview

A comprehensive knowledge base for cognitive modeling, integrating theoretical foundations, mathematical frameworks, and practical implementations across multiple disciplines. This repository serves as the central hub for understanding Active Inference and its applications in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and complex systems research.

## 🎯 Purpose

The knowledge base provides structured, interconnected documentation that supports:

- **Theoretical Understanding**: Deep exploration of Active Inference principles and related concepts
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Rigorous mathematical formulations and derivations
- **Implementation Guidance**: Practical approaches for applying theoretical concepts
- **Cross-Disciplinary Integration**: Connections between cognitive science, biology, mathematics, and systems theory
- **Research Navigation**: Organized access to research topics and methodologies
