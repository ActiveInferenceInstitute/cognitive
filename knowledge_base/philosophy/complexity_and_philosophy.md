# Complexity and Philosophy

Complexity science challenges classical reductionism by emphasizing emergence, nonlinearity, and path dependence. Philosophical implications include new views on explanation, causation, and methodology in the sciences.

## Themes

- Emergent properties and multiple realizability

- Mechanistic vs dynamical explanations

- Inter-level causation and constraints

- Methodological pluralism and model ensembles

See: [[systems_theory]], [[emergence_self_organization]], [[operationalism]].
