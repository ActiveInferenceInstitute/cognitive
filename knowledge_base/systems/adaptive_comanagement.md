# Adaptive Co-management

Adaptive co-management blends adaptive management with collaborative governance in socialâ€“ecological systems (SES). It emphasizes iterative learning, stakeholder participation, and distributed control to manage uncertainty and change.

Core elements:

- Joint monitoring and knowledge integration

- Iterative policy experimentation

- Polycentric institutions and trust building
