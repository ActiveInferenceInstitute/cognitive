# Adaptive Co-management

Adaptive co-management integrates adaptive management principles with collaborative governance approaches to address the complex challenges of social-ecological systems (SES). This framework emphasizes iterative learning, stakeholder participation, power sharing, and institutional flexibility to manage uncertainty, change, and multiple objectives in coupled human-natural systems.

## 🤝 Core Principles

### Collaborative Governance
- **Stakeholder Participation**: Inclusive involvement of diverse actors
- **Power Sharing**: Distributed decision-making authority
- **Knowledge Integration**: Combining scientific and local knowledge
- **Trust Building**: Developing relationships and social capital

### Adaptive Management
- **Iterative Learning**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment cycles
- **Experimental Approaches**: Testing management interventions
- **Uncertainty Acceptance**: Embracing complexity and unpredictability
- **Resilience Focus**: Building system robustness and adaptability

### Integrated Approach
- **Social-Ecological Integration**: Bridging human and natural system management
- **Multi-Scale Coordination**: Linking local, regional, and higher-level governance
- **Long-Term Perspective**: Planning across extended time horizons
- **Equity Considerations**: Fair distribution of costs and benefits

## 🏗️ Framework Components

### Institutional Arrangements
- **Bridging Organizations**: Intermediary institutions facilitating collaboration
- **Nested Governance**: Hierarchical governance with local autonomy
- **Legal Frameworks**: Enabling legislation and regulatory support
- **Capacity Building**: Developing skills and resources for participants

### Knowledge Systems
- **Scientific Knowledge**: Research-based understanding and monitoring
- **Local/Traditional Knowledge**: Place-based experience and wisdom
- **Joint Fact-Finding**: Collaborative knowledge production
- **Learning Platforms**: Mechanisms for sharing and integrating knowledge

### Decision-Making Processes
- **Collaborative Planning**: Joint development of management strategies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mechanisms for addressing disagreements
- **Consensus Building**: Developing shared understanding and agreement
- **Adaptive Implementation**: Flexible execution with monitoring and adjustment
