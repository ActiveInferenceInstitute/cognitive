# Mixed Reality

## Definition and Core Concepts

Mixed Reality (MR) refers to the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. It represents a significant advancement along the reality-virtuality continuum, positioning itself between pure physical reality and fully virtual environments. Mixed Reality creates experiences where the physical and digital are interwoven and responsive to each other, enabling new forms of interaction, visualization, and spatial computing applications.
