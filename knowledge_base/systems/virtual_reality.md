# Virtual Reality

## Definition and Core Concepts

Virtual Reality (VR) is an immersive technology that replaces the user's real-world environment with a completely simulated digital environment. Unlike Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays digital content onto the physical world, VR creates a fully artificial experience that engages multiple sensory channels, primarily vision and hearing, but increasingly touch, smell, and proprioception as well. VR systems create the psychological experience of "presence" - the sensation of being physically located within the virtual environment rather than in the actual physical location.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Immersion**: Creating a sense of being fully enveloped within a virtual environment

1. **Presence**: The psychological sensation of "being there" within the virtual world

1. **Interactivity**: Allowing users to manipulate and influence the virtual environment

1. **Spatial Awareness**: Enabling natural orientation and movement within 3D space

1. **Multi-Sensory Engagement**: Stimulating multiple senses to enhance realism

1. **Agency**: Providing users with the ability to take meaningful actions

### VR Experience Spectrum

The range of virtual reality experiences based on immersion level:

- **Non-Immersive VR**: Desktop-based 3D environments viewed on conventional displays

- **Semi-Immersive VR**: Large projected displays or multi-screen setups with partial immersion

- **Fully Immersive VR**: Head-mounted displays that completely replace visual input

- **Collaborative VR**: Shared virtual environments for multiple simultaneous users

- **Hyper-Immersive VR**: Advanced systems incorporating multiple sensory channels beyond vision

- **Extended Dwell VR**: Systems designed for prolonged immersion over hours or days
