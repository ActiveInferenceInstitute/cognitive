# Educational Programs

## Definition and Core Concepts

Educational programs are structured learning experiences designed to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and competencies. They represent systematic approaches to organizing learning across various contexts, from formal academic institutions to workplace training and self-directed learning environments.

### Key Components

1. **Curriculum**: The organized sequence of learning experiences, content, and assessments
2. **Pedagogy**: Teaching methods and instructional approaches
3. **Assessment**: Methods for evaluating learning and providing feedback
4. **Learning Environment**: Physical or virtual spaces where learning occurs
5. **Learning Community**: Social context and interpersonal dynamics
6. **Resources**: Materials, tools, and technologies supporting learning

## Theoretical Foundations

### Learning Sciences

Educational programs draw on multiple theoretical perspectives from the learning sciences:

- **Behaviorism**: Learning as observable changes in behavior through reinforcement
