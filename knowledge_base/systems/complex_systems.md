# Complex Systems Theory

Complex systems theory provides a framework for understanding systems composed of many interacting parts that exhibit emergent properties not predictable from the properties of individual components. This interdisciplinary field draws from physics, biology, mathematics, and computer science to explain how complexity arises from simplicity and how simple rules can generate sophisticated behaviors.
