# Resilience Thinking

Resilience thinking provides a framework for understanding how complex systems respond to disturbances, adapt to change, and maintain functionality across multiple scales. It emphasizes the capacity of systems to absorb shocks, reorganize when necessary, and persist or transform in the face of uncertainty. This approach shifts focus from equilibrium and prediction to adaptability, learning, and transformation.

## 🌊 Core Concepts

### Resilience Definitions

#### Engineering Resilience
- **Recovery Time**: How quickly a system returns to equilibrium after disturbance
- **Stability Focus**: Maintaining system state and resisting change
- **Efficiency Emphasis**: Optimizing for stability and predictability
- **Equilibrium Assumption**: Systems tend toward stable states

#### Ecological Resilience
- **Absorptive Capacity**: Amount of disturbance a system can withstand
- **Adaptive Capacity**: Ability to learn and reorganize in response to change
- **Transformative Capacity**: Fundamental reorganization when needed
- **Multiple Equilibria**: Systems may have alternative stable states

#### Social-Ecological Resilience
- **Interconnected Systems**: Integration of social and ecological components
- **Cross-Scale Dynamics**: Interactions across temporal and spatial scales
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Continuous knowledge building and adjustment
- **Transformability**: Capacity for fundamental system changes

### Key Resilience Properties

#### Absorptive Capacity
