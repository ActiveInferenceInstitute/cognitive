# Resilience Thinking

Resilience thinking focuses on the capacity of systems to absorb disturbance, reorganize, and persist while undergoing change. It foregrounds thresholds, diversity, feedbacks, and learning.

Key ideas:

- Regime shifts and adaptive cycles

- Diversity and redundancy for robustness

- Learning and experimentation across scales
