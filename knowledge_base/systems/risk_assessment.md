# Risk Assessment

## Overview
Risk assessment is a systematic process of evaluating potential risks and their impacts in [[underwriting]] and insurance contexts. This foundational concept bridges traditional [[underwriting_principles]] with modern [[active_inference]] approaches to uncertainty quantification and decision-making.
