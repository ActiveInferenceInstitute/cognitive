# Ecosystem Management

## Definition and Core Principles

Ecosystem management is an integrated, science-based approach to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of ecological systems and their functions. It represents a shift from managing individual species or resources to maintaining the health, integrity, and resilience of entire ecosystems, considering both ecological processes and human activities within those systems.

### Foundational Principles

1. **Systems Thinking**: Recognition of ecosystems as complex, interconnected systems with emergent properties

1. **Ecological Integrity**: Maintaining the composition, structure, and function of natural ecosystems

1. **Adaptive Management**: Iterative approach of planning, implementing, monitoring, and adjusting practices

1. **Multiple Scales**: Operating across spatial and temporal scales relevant to ecosystem processes

1. **Human Dimensions**: Integrating human needs, values, and activities into management decisions

1. **Collaboration**: Involving diverse stakeholders in planning and implementation

1. **Scientific Foundation**: Basing decisions on best available scientific understanding

## Ecosystem Structure and Function
