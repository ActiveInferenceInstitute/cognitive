# Fault Tolerance

## Definition and Core Concepts

Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more of its components. It is a fundamental concept in designing reliable and resilient systems, especially in critical applications where failures can have severe consequences.

### Key Principles

1. **Redundancy**: Duplication of critical components to ensure functionality when primary components fail
2. **Isolation**: Containing failures to prevent cascading effects
3. **Detection**: Identifying faults quickly and accurately
4. **Recovery**: Mechanisms for returning to normal operation after failures
5. **Prevention**: Design strategies that minimize the likelihood of faults occurring

## Types of Faults

### By Persistence

- **Transient Faults**: Temporary failures that occur once and then disappear (e.g., network packet loss)
- **Intermittent Faults**: Failures that occur occasionally and unpredictably (e.g., race conditions)
- **Permanent Faults**: Failures that persist until the faulty component is repaired or replaced (e.g., hardware failures)

### By Origin

- **Hardware Faults**: Physical component failures (e.g., disk failures, CPU errors)
- **Software Faults**: Bugs, design flaws, or configuration errors in software
- **Network Faults**: Communication failures between system components
- **Operational Faults**: Human errors during system operation or maintenance
- **Environmental Faults**: External conditions affecting system operation (e.g., power outages)

## Redundancy Strategies

### Hardware Redundancy

1. **Passive Redundancy**: Multiple components operate simultaneously, with backup components ready to take over
   - Hot standby: Backup components running in parallel and ready to take over immediately
   - Warm standby: Backup components ready but not fully operational
   - Cold standby: Backup components available but need full initialization

2. **Active Redundancy**: Multiple identical components perform the same operations simultaneously
   - Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR): Three components with voting logic
   - N-Modular Redundancy (NMR): N components with majority voting

3. **Hybrid Redundancy**: Combinations of active and passive approaches

### Information Redundancy

1. **Error Detection Codes**
   - Parity bits
   - Checksums
   - Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC)

2. **Error Correction Codes**
   - Hamming codes
   - Reed-Solomon codes
   - LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes

3. **Data Replication**
   - Synchronous replication
   - Asynchronous replication
   - Semi-synchronous replication

### Time Redundancy

1. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Simple retries
   - Exponential backoff
   - Circuit breakers

2. **Checkpointing and Rollback**
   - Periodic state saving
   - Transaction logs
   - Journaling

### Software Redundancy

1. **N-Version Programming**
   - Multiple implementations of the same functionality
   - Different algorithms or approaches
   - Different development teams

2. **Recovery Blocks**
   - Primary algorithm with acceptance test
   - Alternative algorithms if primary fails acceptance test

3. **Consensus Algorithms**
   - Paxos
   - Raft
   - Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

## Fault Detection

1. **Heartbeat Monitoring**
   - Regular signals indicating component health
   - Timeout-based failure detection

   - Try-catch blocks
   - Error propagation
   - Failure reporting

3. **Health Checks**

### Diagnostic Techniques

   - Continuous validation

2. **Watchdog Timers**
   - Hardware or software timers that trigger recovery if not reset
   - Hierarchical watchdogs

3. **Fault Prediction**

## Implementation Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking operations likely to fail:

1. **Closed State**: Normal operation, requests flow through
2. **Open State**: After failures exceed threshold, requests are rejected
3. **Half-Open State**: Allows limited traffic to test recovery

### Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates components to contain failures:

1. **Thread Pool Isolation**: Dedicated thread pools for different operations
2. **Process Isolation**: Separate processes for critical components
3. **Service Isolation**: Independent services with minimal dependencies

### Timeout Pattern

Prevents resources from being indefinitely blocked:

1. **Connection Timeouts**: Maximum time allowed for establishing connections
2. **Request Timeouts**: Maximum time allowed for request completion
3. **Cascading Timeouts**: Decreasing timeouts for dependent services

### Retry Pattern

Handles transient failures through repeated attempts:

1. **Immediate Retry**: For rare, momentary failures
2. **Fixed Interval**: Consistent delay between retries
3. **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retries
4. **Jitter**: Randomized delays to prevent synchronization
