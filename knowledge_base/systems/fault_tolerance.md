# Fault Tolerance

## Definition and Core Concepts

Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more of its components. It is a fundamental concept in designing reliable and resilient systems, especially in critical applications where failures can have severe consequences.

### Key Principles

1. **Redundancy**: Duplication of critical components to ensure functionality when primary components fail

1. **Isolation**: Containing failures to prevent cascading effects

1. **Detection**: Identifying faults quickly and accurately

1. **Recovery**: Mechanisms for returning to normal operation after failures

1. **Prevention**: Design strategies that minimize the likelihood of faults occurring

## Types of Faults

### By Persistence

- **Transient Faults**: Temporary failures that occur once and then disappear (e.g., network packet loss)

- **Intermittent Faults**: Failures that occur occasionally and unpredictably (e.g., race conditions)

- **Permanent Faults**: Failures that persist until the faulty component is repaired or replaced (e.g., hardware failures)

### By Origin

- **Hardware Faults**: Physical component failures (e.g., disk failures, CPU errors)

- **Software Faults**: Bugs, design flaws, or configuration errors in software

- **Network Faults**: Communication failures between system components

- **Operational Faults**: Human errors during system operation or maintenance

- **Environmental Faults**: External conditions affecting system operation (e.g., power outages)

## Redundancy Strategies

### Hardware Redundancy

1. **Passive Redundancy**: Multiple components operate simultaneously, with backup components ready to take over

   - Hot standby: Backup components running in parallel and ready to take over immediately

   - Warm standby: Backup components ready but not fully operational

   - Cold standby: Backup components available but need full initialization

1. **Active Redundancy**: Multiple identical components perform the same operations simultaneously

   - Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR): Three components with voting logic

   - N-Modular Redundancy (NMR): N components with majority voting

1. **Hybrid Redundancy**: Combinations of active and passive approaches

### Information Redundancy

1. **Error Detection Codes**

   - Parity bits

   - Checksums

   - Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC)

1. **Error Correction Codes**

   - Hamming codes

   - Reed-Solomon codes

   - LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes

1. **Data Replication**

   - Semi-synchronous replication

   - Circuit breakers

1. **Checkpointing and Rollback**

   - Periodic state saving

   - Transaction logs

### Software Redundancy

1. **N-Version Programming**

   - Multiple implementations of the same functionality

   - Different algorithms or approaches

   - Different development teams

1. **Recovery Blocks**

   - Primary algorithm with acceptance test

   - Alternative algorithms if primary fails acceptance test

## Implementation Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking operations likely to fail:

1. **Closed State**: Normal operation, requests flow through

1. **Open State**: After failures exceed threshold, requests are rejected

1. **Half-Open State**: Allows limited traffic to test recovery

### Bulkhead Pattern

Isolates components to contain failures:

1. **Thread Pool Isolation**: Dedicated thread pools for different operations

1. **Process Isolation**: Separate processes for critical components

1. **Service Isolation**: Independent services with minimal dependencies

### Timeout Pattern

Prevents resources from being indefinitely blocked:

1. **Connection Timeouts**: Maximum time allowed for establishing connections

1. **Request Timeouts**: Maximum time allowed for request completion

1. **Cascading Timeouts**: Decreasing timeouts for dependent services

### Retry Pattern

Handles transient failures through repeated attempts:

1. **Immediate Retry**: For rare, momentary failures

1. **Fixed Interval**: Consistent delay between retries

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retries

1. **Jitter**: Randomized delays to prevent synchronization
