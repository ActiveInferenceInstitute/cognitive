## MathGloss Knowledge Graph

### Overview

MathGloss proposes a knowledge graph for undergraduate mathematics, integrating course materials, Wikidata, and multilingual dictionaries to support personalized learning paths and semantic linking.

### Repository Integration

- Use as a scaffold for linking beginner and intermediate topics

- Enrich aliases and cross-links with multilingual terms

- Drive curriculum in [[README|Mathematics Knowledge Base]] → Learning Paths

### Example concept card

- Concept: "Derivative"

  - Aliases: rate of change, differential

  - Prereqs: [[limits]] · [[continuity]]

  - Links: [[variational_calculus]] · [[optimization_theory]]

  - External: MathGloss/Wikidata IDs
