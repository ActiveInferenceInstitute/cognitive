## Policy Search Methods

### Families

- Enumerative / tree search (short horizon)

- Gradient-based (natural gradient on policy parameters)

- Sampling-based (CEM, evolution strategies)

### Notes

- Use EFE as objective surrogate; anneal [[precision_parameter]] during search

- Combine with [[natural_gradients]] for geometry-aware updates
