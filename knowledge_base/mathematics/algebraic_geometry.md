# Algebraic Geometry

## Core Concepts

### Affine Varieties

1. **Polynomial Rings**

   ```math

   k[x_1,...,x_n]/I

   ```

   where:

   - k is field

   - I is ideal

   - x_i are variables

1. **Zero Sets**

   ```math

   V(I) = \{x \in k^n : f(x) = 0 \text{ for all } f \in I\}

   ```

   where:

   - I is ideal

   - k is field

   - V is variety

### Schemes

1. **Spectrum**

   ```math

   \text{Spec}(R) = \{P \subset R : P \text{ is prime ideal}\}

   ```

   where:

   - R is ring

   - P is prime ideal

1. **Structure Sheaf**

   ```math

   \mathcal{O}_X(U) = \{s: U \to \coprod_{p \in U} \mathcal{O}_{X,p}\}

   ```

   where:

   - X is scheme

   - U is open set

   - O_{X,p} is local ring

## Advanced Concepts

### Cohomology Theory

1. **Sheaf Cohomology**

   ```math

   H^i(X,\mathcal{F}) = R^i\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})

   ```

   where:

   - F is sheaf

   - Γ is global sections

   - R^i is derived functor

1. **Čech Cohomology**

   ```math

   \check{H}^i(X,\mathcal{F}) = \varinjlim_{\mathfrak{U}} \check{H}^i(\mathfrak{U},\mathcal{F})

   ```

   where:

   - U is open cover

   - F is sheaf

### Intersection Theory

1. **Intersection Product**

   ```math

   Z_1 \cdot Z_2 = \sum_i m_i[V_i]

   ```

   where:

   - Z_i are cycles

   - m_i are multiplicities

   - V_i are components

1. **Chow Ring**

   ```math

   A^*(X) = \bigoplus_k A^k(X)

   ```

   where:

   - A^k is k-codimensional cycles

   - X is variety

## Applications

### Moduli Spaces

1. **Moduli of Curves**

   ```math

   \mathcal{M}_g = \{[C] : C \text{ is smooth curve of genus } g\}

   ```

   where:

   - g is genus

   - [C] is isomorphism class

1. **Stable Maps**

   ```math

   \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X,\beta)

   ```

   where:

   - g is genus

   - n is marked points

   - β is homology class

### Mirror Symmetry

1. **Hodge Numbers**

   ```math

   h^{p,q}(X) = h^{n-p,q}(X^\vee)

   ```

   where:

   - X is Calabi-Yau

   - X^\vee is mirror

   - h^{p,q} are Hodge numbers

1. **Gromov-Witten Invariants**

   ```math

   \langle τ_{a_1}(γ_1),...,τ_{a_n}(γ_n)\rangle_{g,β}

   ```

   where:

   - τ_a are descendants

   - γ_i are cohomology classes

   - β is curve class

## Implementation

        """Initialize algebraic variety.

        Args:

            polynomials: Defining polynomials

            variables: Variable names

        """

        self.polynomials = polynomials

        Returns:

            basis: Gröbner basis

        """

        # Convert to ideal

        ideal = self._polynomials_to_ideal()

        # Compute basis

        basis = self._buchberger_algorithm(ideal, ordering)

        return basis

    def dimension(self) -> int:

        """Compute variety dimension.

        Returns:

            dim: Krull dimension

        """

        # Get Gröbner basis

        basis = self.compute_groebner_basis()

        # Compute dimension

        return self._krull_dimension(basis)

```

    def __init__(self,

                 variety: AlgebraicVariety):

        """Initialize intersection theory.

        Args:

            variety: Algebraic variety

        """

        self.variety = variety

    def intersection_product(self,

                           cycle1: Cycle,

                           cycle2: Cycle) -> Cycle:

        """Compute intersection product.

        Args:

            cycle1: First cycle

            cycle2: Second cycle

        Returns:

            product: Intersection product

        """

        # Compute proper intersection

        components = self._proper_intersection(cycle1, cycle2)

        # Get multiplicities

        multiplicities = self._intersection_multiplicities(

            cycle1, cycle2, components

        )

        return Cycle(components, multiplicities)

    def chern_class(self,

                   bundle: VectorBundle) -> ChernClass:

        """Compute Chern class.

        Args:

            bundle: Vector bundle

        Returns:

            chern: Chern class

        """

        return self._compute_chern_class(bundle)

```
