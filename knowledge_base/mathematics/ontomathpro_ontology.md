## OntoMathPRO

### Overview

OntoMathPRO covers a broad spectrum of mathematical fields, supporting semantic search, information extraction, and education. It is a useful hub for aligning internal concept pages to web ontologies.

### Integration Patterns

- Map page aliases to OntoMathPRO labels

- Use ontology relations to propose missing cross-links

- Support semantic navigation in [[cross_reference_map]]

### Workflow for alignment

1. Extract titles/aliases from internal pages

1. Query OntoMathPRO for candidate matches (label, altLabel)

1. Record mappings (exact, close, related) with URIs

1. Propagate links back into pages and indexes

### Example mapping

- Internal: "Bayes' theorem" → OntoMathPRO: `http://ontomathpro.org/ontology/E1087` (exact)

- Internal: "Markov blanket" → related entries (close), add see-also relations

### External
