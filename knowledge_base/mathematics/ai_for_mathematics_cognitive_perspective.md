## AI for Mathematics – Cognitive Perspective

### Overview

Research on building AI systems capable of mathematical reasoning informed by cognitive science. Aligns algorithmic design with human cognitive processes.

### Problem facets

- Concept learning and representation (definitions, theorems, schemas)

- Heuristic search and strategy selection (problem-solving tactics)

- Abstraction and analogy (transfer across problem families)

- Explanation and proof (human-interpretable reasoning traces)

### Cognitive mappings

- Working memory ↔ structured scratchpads and intermediate states

- Metacognition ↔ controller over tools/strategies with performance monitoring

- Prior knowledge ↔ libraries of lemmas/patterns with probabilistic retrieval

### Research directions

- Probabilistic program synthesis guided by cognitive priors

- Information-geometric embeddings of mathematical objects [[information_geometry]]

- Active selection of subgoals via expected information gain [[exploration_exploitation]]

### Benchmarks and datasets

- MiniF2F, MATH, Polymath-like collaborative proofs

- Synthetic curricula for algebra/geometry with step-level annotations
