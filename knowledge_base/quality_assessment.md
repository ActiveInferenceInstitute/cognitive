✅ Established selection guidelines and comparison matrices

✅ Outlined development roadmap and research directions

**Next Steps:**

- [ ] Expand GenericPOMDP documentation

- [ ] Complete Continuous_Time implementation guides

- [ ] Add hierarchical and multi-agent architectures

- [ ] Create tutorial examples for each architecture type

#### 4. Ontological Structure (⭐⭐⭐ → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

**Current Issues:**
