# Allostatic Control

Allostatic control refers to anticipatory regulation that adjusts internal setpoints and control policies in expectation of future demands. Within active inference, allostasis emerges by minimizing expected free energy over anticipated outcomes, adapting precisions and preferences to maintain viability under changing contexts.

## Conceptual contrast

- Homeostasis: reactive error correction to restore a fixed setpoint.

- Allostasis: proactive adjustment of setpoints, gains, and policies given predicted conditions.

## Mathematical sketch

Let \(h\) denote controlled variables and \(h^*(\theta)\) context-dependent setpoints parameterized by latent context \(\theta\).

```math

\dot{h} = f(h,a) + w,\quad a^* = \arg\min_a\; \mathbb{E}_{q(o_{t:T}|a)}[G]

```

Allostatic update of setpoints and precisions:

```math

\dot{h}^* = -\kappa_h\, \partial_{h^*} \mathbb{E}[G]\,,\quad

\dot{\Pi} = -\kappa_\Pi\, \partial_{\Pi} F

```

where \(\Pi\) are precision parameters modulating prediction errors (see [[precision_weighting]]), \(F\) is variational free energy, and \(G\) is expected free energy.

## Mechanisms

- Preference adaptation: update prior preferences [[C_matrix]] in response to slow context.

- Precision control: adjust sensory and policy precisions to allocate exploration vs exploitation.

- Policy foresight: evaluate multi-horizon policies for resource and risk management.
