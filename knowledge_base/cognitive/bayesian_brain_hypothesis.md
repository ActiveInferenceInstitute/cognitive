## Bayesian Brain Hypothesis

The Bayesian brain hypothesis proposes that neural systems encode and update probabilistic beliefs about hidden causes of sensory input. It underpins frameworks such as [[../cognitive/predictive_coding]] and [[active_inference]], where the brain performs approximate [[../mathematics/variational_inference]] to minimize prediction error and free energy.

## Key Ideas

- Perception as inference under a generative model

- Priors and likelihoods integrated to form posteriors

- Precision (inverse variance) modulates prediction-error weighting
