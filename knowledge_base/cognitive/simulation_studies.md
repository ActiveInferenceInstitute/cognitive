# Simulation Studies

Simulation studies test whether models reproduce qualitative phenomena and achieve quantitative performance under controlled conditions. Good practice includes ablation, sensitivity analysis, and reporting uncertainty.

Checklist:

- Reproducible configuration and seeds

- Clear objectives and hypotheses

- Metrics tied to theory (e.g., EFE components)

- Visualization and diagnostics

See: [[validation]], [[implementation_patterns]].
