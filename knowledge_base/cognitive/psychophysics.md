# Psychophysics

Psychophysics quantifies the mapping between physical stimuli and perceptual reports. Signal detection theory provides a normative framework connecting sensitivity and decision criteria with Bayesian inference.

d' = \frac{\mu_s - \mu_n}{\sigma}\,,\quad P(\text{hit})\,,\;P(\text{FA})\;\text{from criterion }\beta

```
