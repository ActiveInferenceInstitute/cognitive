# Graph Visualization

Graph visualization renders relational structure for interpretation, validation, and discovery. In cognitive modeling, it aids inspection of generative models, factor graphs, and concept ontologies.

## Practices

- Layouts: force-directed, hierarchical, radial for multi-scale structure

- Encoding: node color/shape by type; edge width by weight/precision

- Interactivity: filtering by community, degree, or uncertainty
