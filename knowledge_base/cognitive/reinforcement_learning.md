# Reinforcement Learning (Comparison)

Reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes expected cumulative reward via value functions and policy improvement. In contrast, [[active_inference]] selects actions by minimizing [[../mathematics/expected_free_energy]], which unifies exploration (epistemic value) and exploitation (preference satisfaction) under a single probabilistic objective.

## Mappings

- Reward ↔ log prior preference over observations

- Value function ↔ negative expected free energy

- Policy gradient ↔ free energy gradient
