# Communication

Communication can be framed as coordinated inference between senders and receivers. Messages are actions that shape the receiverâ€™s observations to reduce uncertainty (epistemic value) and align preferences (pragmatic value).

## Information-theoretic view

```math

I(M;R) = H(R) - H(R|M)\,,\quad G = \mathbb{E}[\text{information gain}] + \mathbb{E}[\text{preference fulfillment}]

```

Designing messages to maximize mutual information while respecting costs/prior preferences aligns with minimizing expected free energy.

## Components

- Encoding policy: maps beliefs and goals to signal forms

- Decoding policy: updates beliefs from received signals

- Shared priors: conventions that enable efficient codes and disambiguation
