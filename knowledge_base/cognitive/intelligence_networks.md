# Intelligence Networks

Intelligence networks are distributed systems whose structure and dynamics support perception, learning, and decision-making. They integrate heterogeneous modules (memory, attention, valuation) through message passing that implements approximate Bayesian inference.

## Structural motifs

- Small-world connectivity for efficient integration

- Modular communities for specialization

- Hub nodes for control and routing

See: [[neural_architectures]], [[network_science]], [[cognitive_architecture]].

## Dynamics and computation

- Belief propagation on factor graphs for inference; predictive coding as local error passing

- Synchronization and communication-through-coherence for selective routing

- Precision control as gain modulation over edges/nodes [[precision_weighting]]

## Empirical exemplars

- Language networks: fronto-temporal hubs coordinating syntax and semantics

- Control networks: frontoparietal and salience systems orchestrating task sets

- Memory systems: hippocampal–neocortical coupling for consolidation

## Modeling approaches

- Graphical models (Bayesian networks, factor graphs) for causal structure [[probabilistic_graphical_models]]

- Recurrent neural architectures with structured connectivity [[neural_architectures]]

- Multi-agent networks for collective intelligence [[collective_behavior]]
