# Computer Science Ontology (CSO)

The Computer Science Ontology organizes CS topics and their relations. It supports semantic indexing, discovery, and analytics across publications and repositories.

## Applications

- Tagging documents with standardized topics

- Discovering related areas and trends

- Mapping internal pages to external concepts for interoperability

## Integration workflow

1. Extract candidate topics and aliases from pages

1. Match to CSO concepts (labels/relations)

1. Record URIs and relation types (exact/close/related)

1. Propagate links to indexes and learning paths

See also: [[cross_reference_map]].

  R --> X[Cross Reference Map]

  X --> I[Indexes]
