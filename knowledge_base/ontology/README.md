# Ontology Knowledge Base

This knowledge base contains 3 comprehensive documents covering ontological frameworks, knowledge organization, and semantic structures essential for cognitive modeling and knowledge representation. The content focuses on cognitive ontology, computer science ontology, and hyperspatial concepts.

## 🧬 Overview

The ontology knowledge base provides frameworks for organizing knowledge, representing concepts, and understanding semantic relationships in cognitive systems. It connects philosophical ontology with practical knowledge engineering, emphasizing structured approaches to cognition and intelligence.

## 📚 Content Organization

### 🧠 Cognitive Ontology

#### Knowledge Frameworks
- [[cognitive_ontology]] - Cognitive concept organization and taxonomy
- [[computer_science_ontology]] - Computer science knowledge structures

#### Advanced Concepts
- [[hyperspatial/|Hyperspatial Ontology Knowledge Base]] - Higher-dimensional and topological frameworks
