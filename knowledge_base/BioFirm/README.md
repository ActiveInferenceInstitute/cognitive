# BioFirm Knowledge Base

This knowledge base contains 7 comprehensive documents covering Biological Firm Theory, an innovative framework that integrates Active Inference with ecological economics and biological principles. The content explores how biological systems can inform economic and organizational theory through cognitive and adaptive principles.

## 🌿 Overview

The BioFirm knowledge base presents Biological Firm Theory as a synthesis of Active Inference, ecological economics, and biological systems thinking. It provides theoretical foundations for understanding organizations as living, adaptive systems that learn and evolve through predictive processes, much like biological organisms.
