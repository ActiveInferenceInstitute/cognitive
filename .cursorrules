# Cognitive Modeling Framework - Cursor Rules

## Documentation Requirements

### Folder-Level Documentation
- Every folder must have an AGENTS.md file for technical documentation
- Every folder must have a README.md file for overview and navigation
- AGENTS.md files must be accurate and complete technical documentation for their folder
- Documentation should be understated and "show not tell"

### Documentation Standards
- Follow established patterns from existing AGENTS.md files
- Maintain Obsidian linking standards with proper [[link]] syntax
- Use semantic_relations in YAML frontmatter for concept relationships
- Documentation should be professional, effective, and informative

## Code Quality Standards

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Always use test-driven development with a unified modular approach
- Write tests before implementation
- Ensure all modules have corresponding tests
- No mock methods - always do real data analysis

### Code Organization
- Use modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned code
- Follow professional, functional, intelligent, wise, modular, concise, elegant, thoughtful patterns
- Code should be clearly-commented and interpretable
- Avoid redundant code sections and scripts

### Method Standards
- All public methods must have complete docstrings
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Add informative logging to key methods
- Methods should be professional, effective, and real (not mock)
- Document methods with clear reasoning and examples where appropriate

### Logging Requirements
- Add informative logging throughout the codebase
- Logging should be structured and meaningful
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Log important state changes and decision points

## Naming Conventions

### Remove Redundant Adjectives
- Remove non-semantic adjectives from file names, method names, and documentation:
  - "enhanced", "real", "new", "improved", "better" should be removed
  - Examples:
    - "enhanced_method.py" → "method.py"
    - "get_new_data()" → "get_data()"
    - "new framework" → "framework"
- Preserve semantic adjectives that add meaning:
  - "continuous_time", "discrete_state", "hierarchical_processing" are acceptable

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with underscores
- Be descriptive and concise
- Follow established patterns in the repository
- Avoid redundant descriptors

### Method Naming
- Use snake_case for Python methods
- Be descriptive and action-oriented
- Avoid redundant adjectives
- Follow verb_object pattern where appropriate

## Testing Requirements

### Test Structure
- All tests should be in the tests/ directory
- Test files should follow test_*.py naming convention
- Tests should be comprehensive and cover edge cases
- Integration tests should be documented

### Test Documentation
- Document test architecture in tests/AGENTS.md
- Provide test suite overview in tests/README.md
- Document test utilities and fixtures
- Include examples of integration tests

## Repository Standards

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Documentation updated (AGENTS.md, README.md)
- [ ] Tests added and passing
- [ ] No redundant adjectives in names
- [ ] Logging added where appropriate
- [ ] Method docstrings complete
- [ ] Type hints included
- [ ] Obsidian links validated
- [ ] Code follows modular patterns

### Validation Requirements
- Assess where and how to make intelligent improvements
- Review methods, logging, documentation for completeness
- Ensure every folder has accurate and complete AGENTS.md and README.md
- Scan repo entirely before acting to ensure intelligent decisions

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Scan the repository to understand context
2. Assess where improvements can be made
3. Review existing patterns and conventions
4. Plan changes thoughtfully

### Making Changes
1. Follow TDD approach
2. Update documentation alongside code
3. Add informative logging
4. Ensure backward compatibility where possible
5. Remove redundant code and adjectives

### After Making Changes
1. Run tests to ensure everything works
2. Verify documentation is updated
3. Check that links are valid
4. Review for any other needed improvements
5. Add observations and needed edits summary

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Professional, functional, intelligent, wise code
- Modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned
- Clearly-commented and interpretable
- Avoid redundancy

### Documentation Quality
- Accurate and complete technical documentation
- Understated and "show not tell" style
- Professional and effective
- Informative logging and signposting

### Architecture Quality
- Unified modular approach
- Thoughtful orchestration
- Comprehensive validation
- Complete functionality

## Obsidian Integration

### Linking Standards
- Use [[link]] syntax for internal links
- Verify links are properly formatted
- Check for broken internal links
- Ensure semantic_relations are accurate in YAML frontmatter

### Knowledge Organization
- Maintain consistent folder structure
- Follow established linking patterns
- Use semantic relationships appropriately
- Keep knowledge base organized and navigable

## Summary

Always consider and review possible improvements to:
- Methods, tests, documentation, signposting, logging
- Orchestration, validation, functionality, completeness, accuracy
- Ensure every folder level has accurate and complete AGENTS.md and README.md
- Use professional, effective, real methods that are documented, tested, and have informative logging
- Follow modular, well-documented, clearly reasoned code patterns
- Documentation and descriptions should be understated and "show not tell"
- Scan the repo entirely before acting to ensure intelligent decisions
- Avoid redundant code sections and scripts
- No mock methods - always do real data analysis
