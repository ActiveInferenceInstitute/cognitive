# InferAnt Stream 10.2: 
plain_text too: Learning Paths, Application Guides, and More Things. 

This stream focuses on advancing our understanding and application of Active Infere ce and cognitive modeling concepts through learning paths, detailed application guides (initially for RxInfer.jl package), a Generic Thing repo with test suite, and other resources.

## Stream Information

- **Platform**: YouTube and Beyond. 
- **Repository**: <https://github.com/ActiveInferenceInstitute/cognitive>
- **Tools**:
  - **Obsidian**: A powerful knowledge base and note-taking tool. <https://obsidian.md/>
  - **CodeViz**: Visualizes code structures for better understanding. <https://codeviz.ai/>
  - **Cursor**: Enhances coding efficiency with AI assistance. <https://www.cursor.com/>

## Agenda

- Start with Github push & Obsidian publication
- Generic Thing (start debugging) 
- Learning Paths
- RxInfer.jl 
- Back to Generic, and other, Things

### New Developments

- **Learning Paths**: Structured educational journeys designed to guide learners through the complexities of cognitive modeling, from foundational theories to advanced implementations.
- **RxInfer and Implementations**: Exploration of RxInfer, a tool for implementing active inference models, along with practical examples and case studies.
- **Generic Thing**: A placeholder for additional topics or tools that may be introduced during the stream, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to new developments.
