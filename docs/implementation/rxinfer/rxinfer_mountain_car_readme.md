# RxInfer Mountain Car Implementation: A Tale of Active Inference

## The Journey from Classical Control to Active Inference

Imagine standing at the bottom of a steep valley with an underpowered car. Your goal? Reach the summit. The catch? Your engine alone isn't strong enough to climb directly. This is the classic Mountain Car problem, but today we're going to solve it in a fundamentally different way - not through traditional reinforcement learning or optimal control, but through the lens of [[active_inference|Active Inference]].

### Why Active Inference?

Traditional approaches to the Mountain Car problem often rely on:
- [[reinforcement_learning|Reinforcement Learning]]: Learning value functions through trial and error
- [[optimal_control|Optimal Control]]: Computing optimal trajectories through dynamic programming
- [[pid_control|PID Control]]: Using feedback loops to maintain desired states

However, these approaches have limitations:
- They often require extensive training data
- They struggle with uncertainty in dynamics
- They lack a unified framework for perception and action

Enter [[active_inference|Active Inference]] - a framework that:
- Unifies perception and action under a single principle
- Naturally handles uncertainty in both state estimation and control
- Provides a biologically-plausible model of adaptive behavior
- Emerges from first principles of [[free_energy|free energy minimization]]

## The Mountain Car Challenge

### Environment Dynamics

The environment consists of:
- **State Space**: Position \(x \in [-1.2, 0.6]\) and velocity \(v \in [-0.07, 0.07]\)
- **Action Space**: Force \(a \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\) representing left, no push, and right
- **Goal**: Reach position \(x \geq 0.5\)

The state transition dynamics follow:

\[
\begin{aligned}
v_{t+1} &= v_t + 0.001a_t - 0.0025\cos(3x_t) \\
x_{t+1} &= x_t + v_{t+1}
\end{aligned}
\]

### Key Challenges

1. **Energy Efficiency**: The car must use minimal energy to reach the goal
2. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balancing between exploring new strategies and exploiting known ones
3. **State Uncertainty**: Dealing with noisy observations and imperfect dynamics
4. **Long-term Planning**: Developing strategies that consider future consequences

## Active Inference Solution

### The Active Inference Framework

Active inference frames the Mountain Car problem as:
- A [[belief_updating|belief updating]] problem about current states
- A [[policy_selection|policy selection]] problem about future actions
- A [[free_energy_minimization|free energy minimization]] problem combining both

### Model Specification

We implement the Mountain Car as a [[probabilistic_models|probabilistic model]] using RxInfer's `@model` macro:

```julia
@model function mountain_car_model(T)
    # Initial state
    x = Vector{Random}(undef, T+1)
    v = Vector{Random}(undef, T+1)
    
    # Initial conditions
    x[1] ~ Normal(-0.5, 0.1)  # Start near bottom of valley
    v[1] ~ Normal(0.0, 0.01)  # Start with minimal velocity
    
    # Policy sequence
    π = Vector{Random}(undef, T)
    for t in 1:T
        π[t] ~ Categorical([0.33, 0.34, 0.33])  # Three possible actions
    end
    
    # State transitions
    for t in 1:T
        # Velocity update with mountain car dynamics
        v[t+1] ~ Normal(
            v[t] + 0.001*(π[t] == 1 ? -1.0 : π[t] == 2 ? 0.0 : 1.0) - 0.0025*cos(3*x[t]),
            0.01
        )
        
        # Position update
        x[t+1] ~ Normal(x[t] + v[t+1], 0.01)
    end
    
    return π
end
```

### [[variational_constraints|Inference Constraints]]

We specify factorization constraints for efficient inference:

```julia
@constraints function mountain_car_constraints()
    # Temporal factorization
    q(x[1:T], v[1:T], π[1:T]) = q(x[1])q(v[1])∏(t->q(x[t+1])q(v[t+1])q(π[t]), 1:T)
    
    # Distribution families
    q(x[t]) :: NormalMeanPrecision
    q(v[t]) :: NormalMeanPrecision
    q(π[t]) :: Categorical
end
```

### [[message_passing|Message Passing]] Implementation

The inference process utilizes:
1. **[[factor_graphs|Factor Graph]] Structure**:
   - Nodes represent variables and factors
   - Edges represent probabilistic dependencies
   - Messages flow between nodes

2. **[[belief_propagation|Belief Propagation]]**:
   - Forward messages for prediction
   - Backward messages for correction
   - Iterative updates for convergence

3. **[[precision_weighting|Precision Weighting]]**:
   - Dynamic adjustment of confidence
   - Balancing sensory and prior information
   - Adaptive learning rates

### [[free_energy|Free Energy]] Components

The active inference framework optimizes the [[expected_free_energy|Expected Free Energy]] (EFE):

1. **[[ambiguity|Ambiguity Term]]**: 
   - Measures uncertainty in state estimation
   - Drives information-seeking behavior
   - Promotes exploration of uncertain states

2. **[[risk|Risk Term]]**: 
   - Measures deviation from preferred states
   - Guides goal-directed behavior
   - Penalizes suboptimal trajectories

3. **[[complexity|Complexity Term]]**: 
   - Penalizes deviation from prior beliefs
   - Regularizes policy selection
   - Promotes efficient solutions

### [[policy_selection|Policy Selection]]

Policy selection is performed by minimizing the EFE:

```julia
function select_policy(model, policies, goal_position)
    G = zeros(length(policies))
    for (i, π) in enumerate(policies)
        # Compute expected free energy components
        ambiguity = compute_ambiguity(model, π)
        risk = compute_risk(model, π, goal_position)
        complexity = compute_complexity(model, π)
        
        G[i] = -(ambiguity + risk + complexity)
    end
    return softmax(-G)  # Convert to policy probabilities
end
```

    π_high ~ Categorical([0.5, 0.5])
    
    # Strategy-dependent low-level policies
    π_low = Vector{Random}(undef, T)
    for t in 1:T
        π_low[t] ~ Categorical(
            π_high == 1 ? [0.6, 0.2, 0.2] : [0.2, 0.2, 0.6]
        )
    end
    # ... state transitions ...
end
```
