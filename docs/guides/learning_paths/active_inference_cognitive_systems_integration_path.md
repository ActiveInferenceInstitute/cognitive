# Cognitive Systems Integration Learning Path

## Quick Start

- Add a contract test for a belief-update microservice interface in `Generic_Thing`

- Wire minimal `tools/src/models/active_inference` components and assert telemetry/latency bounds

- Document interfaces and trace propagation across services

## External Web Resources

- [Centralized resources hub](./index.md#centralized-external-web-resources)

- SRE/Resilience references (Google SRE, Chaos Engineering) in the hub for observability patterns
