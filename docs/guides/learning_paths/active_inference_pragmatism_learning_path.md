# Active Inference Pragmatism Learning Path

> "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object." - Charles Sanders Peirce

3. How does social inquiry shape belief updating?
4. What role does experience play in operational knowledge?

> "The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made true by events." - William James

Remember: The pragmatic approach to active inference emphasizes practical consequences, operational definitions, and the continuous testing of ideas through experience and action. Your understanding should be grounded in practical effects and measurable outcomes.
