# Are You Experienced? A Journey Through Active Inference and Scientific Method

## Quick Start

- Keep a 7-day experience log with explicit conjectures and potential falsifiers; treat prediction errors as learning signals

- Run one “action-research” micro-cycle: plan → act → observe → reflect → revise; document belief updates

- Summarize insights into an operational definition you can test next week

This learning path explores the deep connections between [[experience]], [[scientific method]], and the fundamental principles that govern both our understanding of the world and our minds. Like Hendrix's revolutionary approach to music, we'll explore revolutionary ideas in science and cognition through the lens of [[critical rationalism]].

> "The growth of knowledge proceeds from old problems to new problems" - Karl Popper

Remember: Like Hendrix's mastery of the guitar and Popper's pursuit of truth, understanding these principles comes through practice, experimentation, and bold exploration. Let your mind be free to experience, predict, and learn while maintaining [[critical rationalism|critical thinking]].
