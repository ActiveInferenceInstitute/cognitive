## Conceptual Frameworks and Models

### Active Inference in Spatial Computing: Theoretical Framework

The integration of active inference with spatial computing creates a powerful theoretical framework that bridges cognitive science and technology:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Free Energy Principle] --> B[Active Inference]
    B --> C[Perception as Inference]
    B --> D[Action as Inference]
    B --> E[Learning as Model Optimization]
    
    C --> F[Spatial Perception]
    D --> G[Spatial Interaction]
    E --> H[Spatial Learning]
    
    F --> I[Hierarchical Spatial Models]
    F --> J[Precision-Weighted Attention]
    F --> K[Cross-Modal Integration]
    
    G --> L[Policy Selection]
    G --> M[Expected Free Energy Minimization]
    G --> N[Embodied Spatial Interaction]
    
    H --> O[Prediction Error-Driven Learning]
    H --> P[Model Complexity Management]
    H --> Q[Transfer Learning]
    
    I --> R[Spatial Computing Applications]
    J --> R
    K --> R
    L --> R
    M --> R
    N --> R
    O --> R
    P --> R
    Q --> R
```

This framework illustrates how the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference provide a unified theoretical basis for understanding perception, action, and learning in spatial computing contexts. The hierarchical structure shows how fundamental principles cascade into specific mechanisms and ultimately into practical applications.

### Perception-Action-Learning Cycle in Spatial Contexts

The cyclical nature of active inference in spatial computing can be visualized as a continuous process:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Spatial Perception] -->|Generates predictions| B[Prediction Errors]
    B -->|Updates| C[Generative Model]
    C -->|Informs| D[Policy Selection]
    D -->|Guides| E[Spatial Action]
    E -->|Changes| F[Sensory Input]
    F -->|Compared with predictions| A
    
    G[Precision Weighting] -->|Modulates| B
    H[Prior Beliefs] -->|Influence| C
    I[Expected Free Energy] -->|Optimizes| D
    J[Environmental Feedback] -->|Shapes| F
    
    C -->|Improves through| K[Model Learning]
    K -->|Refines| C
```

This diagram illustrates the continuous cycle of perception, prediction, action, and learning that characterizes active inference in spatial computing environments. The cycle shows how prediction errors drive model updates, which inform action selection, leading to new sensory inputs that generate new predictions.

### Hierarchical Predictive Processing in Spatial Computing

The hierarchical nature of predictive processing in spatial contexts:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "High-Level Processing"
        A[Semantic Understanding] --> B[Scene Context]
        B --> C[Task Goals]
        C --> D[Social Dynamics]
    end
    
    subgraph "Mid-Level Processing"
        E[Object Recognition] --> F[Spatial Relationships]
        F --> G[Event Prediction]
        G --> H[Affordance Detection]
    end
    
    subgraph "Low-Level Processing"
        I[Feature Detection] --> J[Motion Tracking]
        J --> K[Depth Perception]
        K --> L[Surface Properties]
    end
    
    D --> E
    H --> I
    
    subgraph "Prediction Flow"
        M[Top-Down Predictions]
    end
    
    subgraph "Error Flow"
        N[Bottom-Up Prediction Errors]
    end
    
    D --> M
    M --> H
    M --> L
    
    L --> N
    N --> H
    N --> D
```

This hierarchical model illustrates how spatial computing systems process information at multiple levels of abstraction, with bidirectional flows of predictions (top-down) and prediction errors (bottom-up) enabling coherent understanding and interaction with spatial environments.

### Bayesian Brain and Spatial Perception

The Bayesian brain hypothesis provides a fundamental framework for understanding how humans perceive and interact with spatial environments:

```mermaid

    A[Bayesian Brain] --> B[Prior Beliefs]
    A --> C[Sensory Evidence]
    A --> D[Posterior Updates]
    
    B --> E[Spatial Expectations]
    C --> F[Spatial Sensory Input]
    D --> G[Updated Spatial Model]
    
    E --> H[Predictive Spatial Interfaces]

    I --> P[Environmental Context]
    
    J --> Q[Self-Optimizing Environments]
    J --> R[Personalized Spatial Experiences]
    J --> S[Learning from User Behavior]
```

**Key Connections:**

  - Where spatial interfaces aim to minimize the divergence between predicted states q(s|a,μ) and actual states p(s|μ)
  - While maximizing the likelihood of observations E<sub>q</sub>[ln p(o|s)]

**Applications in Spatial Web:**

    subgraph "High-Level Processing"
        A[Semantic Understanding] --> B[Goal Inference]
        B --> C[Task Planning]
        C --> D[Social Context]
    end
    
    subgraph "Mid-Level Processing"
        E[Object Recognition] --> F[Spatial Relationships]
        F --> G[Event Prediction]
        G --> H[Affordance Detection]
    end
    
    subgraph "Low-Level Processing"
        I[Feature Detection] --> J[Motion Tracking]
        J --> K[Depth Perception]
        K --> L[Surface Properties]
    end
    
    D --> E
    H --> I

    M --> L
    D --> M
    
    N[Bottom-Up Prediction Errors] --> H
    N --> D
    L --> N
```

**Hierarchical Design Principles:**
- **Temporal Depth**: Different levels operate at different timescales, from immediate sensory processing to long-term goal planning
- **Abstraction Gradient**: Higher levels deal with abstract concepts while lower levels handle concrete sensory details
- **Bidirectional Flow**: Top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors create a dynamic equilibrium

**Applications in Spatial Web:**

    H --> S[Reliability Metrics]
    
    K --> T[Onboarding Experiences]
    K --> U[Context Switching Support]
    K --> V[Skill Acquisition Assistance]
```

**Mathematical Basis:**
- **Precision as Inverse Variance**: π = 1/σ²

### Markov Blankets and System Boundaries

The concept of Markov blankets helps define boundaries between users, devices, and environments in spatial computing:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "User"
        A[Internal States]
        B[Sensory States]
        C[Active States]
    end
    
    subgraph "Spatial Interface"
        D[Interface Internal States]
        E[Input Mechanisms]
        F[Output Displays]
    end
    
    subgraph "Environment"
        G[Physical Space]
        H[Other Users]
        I[Digital Content]
    end
    
    B <--> E
    C <--> E
    F <--> B
    F <--> G
    E <--> G
    H <--> G
    I <--> F
    I <--> G
    
    A <--> B
    A <--> C
    B <--> C
    
    D <--> E
    D <--> F
    E <--> F
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Nested Markov Blankets**: Systems within systems, each with their own boundaries
- **Information Exchange**: Controlled flow across boundaries through sensory and active states
