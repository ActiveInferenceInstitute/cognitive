# Active Inference and Observation Learning Path

## Quick Start

- Adopt a daily observation journal with defined prompts and bias checks

- Implement a minimal observation model (attention/precision) and reflect on outcomes

- Connect inner/outer observation exercises to belief updating narratives

## External Web Resources

- [Centralized resources hub](./index.md#centralized-external-web-resources)

- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Phenomenology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/)

- [NIH NCCIH: Mindfulness Meditation](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/mindfulness-meditation-what-you-need-to-know)

## Overview

This learning path explores the profound relationship between observation, human judgment, and active inference. It examines how the act of observation itself shapes our understanding and beliefs, while connecting these insights to the mathematical framework of active inference. The path integrates perspectives from cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and computational neuroscience to build a comprehensive understanding of how agents (both human and artificial) perceive, learn from, and influence their environment through observation.
