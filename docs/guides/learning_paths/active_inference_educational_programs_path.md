# Active Inference in Educational Programs Learning Path

## Quick Start

- Align on core foundations (see the centralized hub in `index.md`), then draft a one-week micro-curriculum using prediction error as the primary learning signal

- Run a pilot with “assessment-as-inference”: pre/post concept maps, formative checks tied to model updates, and precision-weighted feedback

- Reflect using a short Kolb cycle and Schön’s reflective practice; adjust scaffolding (precision) and content difficulty
