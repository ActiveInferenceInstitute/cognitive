# Active Inference in Economic Systems Learning Path

## Overview

This specialized path focuses on applying Active Inference to understand economic systems, market dynamics, and decision-making under uncertainty. It integrates economic theory with complex systems modeling, emphasizing the use of active inference principles to model and predict economic behaviors and outcomes.

This learning path is designed as a co-learning program between Economics departments and the Active Inference Institute, accommodating diverse backgrounds in mathematics, biology, economics, and computer science. The program spans three quarters, offering multiple tracks and contribution avenues for participants from various disciplines.
