### **Multi-Agent Design Inspired by György Buzsáki's Research**

This design integrates principles from György Buzsáki's research on the hippocampus, particularly focusing on **sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs)**, **neuronal replay**, **temporal dynamics**, and **memory consolidation mechanisms**. The following directives provide a clear and precise framework for implementing the multi-agent system in accordance with these neurobiological insights.

## **Directives for Designing and Coding the Multi-Agent System**

### **1. Knowledge Graph as a Hippocampal Memory Network**
The global knowledge graph ($$ \mathcal{G} $$) is represented as a distributed memory network analogous to the hippocampus. Each node corresponds to a "memory trace" (e.g., an event or hypothesis), and edges represent associations between these traces. Temporal metadata (timestamps) are included for each node to encode episodic context. Edge strengths are used to represent the frequency of reinforcement during replay.

```python
knowledge_graph = {
    "node1": {
        "contents": "Event A occurred.",
        "embedding": np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]),
        "neighbors": {"node2": 0.8, "node3": 0.5},  # Edge strengths
        "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:30:00",  # Temporal metadata
    },
    # Additional nodes...
}
```

---

### **2. Agents as Replay Mechanisms**
Agents act as hippocampal replay mechanisms, traversing the graph to strengthen associations, consolidate memories, and guide future navigation. Replay processes include **awake replay** during exploration pauses and **compressed replay** to simulate SPW-R-like rapid reactivation of sequences.

#### Awake Replay
Awake replay revisits recently traversed paths during pauses in exploration to reinforce connections between nodes.

```python
def awake_replay(agent):
    """Simulate awake replay by reactivating past trajectories."""
    for node in agent.local_graph.keys():
        for neighbor in agent.local_graph[node]["neighbors"]:
            if neighbor in agent.local_graph:
                # Strengthen edge weights between visited nodes
                agent.global_graph[node]["neighbors"][neighbor] += 0.1
```

#### Compressed Replay
Compressed replay rapidly traverses sequences of nodes at a faster timescale, mirroring SPW-R dynamics.

```python
def compressed_replay(agent):
    """Simulate compressed replay by rapidly traversing past paths."""
    trajectory = list(agent.local_graph.keys())
    for i in range(len(trajectory) - 1):
        current_node = trajectory[i]
        next_node = trajectory[i + 1]
        # Strengthen connection between consecutive nodes
        agent.global_graph[current_node]["neighbors"][next_node] += 0.2
```

---

### **3. Temporal Dynamics and Memory Prioritization**
Temporal metadata is used to prioritize nodes for navigation and consolidation. A decay function is implemented for edge strengths over time, simulating forgetting unless reinforced by replay. Timestamps are used to compute temporal relevance when selecting nodes during navigation.

```python
def temporal_decay_function(timestamp):
    """Simulate decay of edge strength over time."""
    current_time = datetime.now()
    time_difference = (current_time - datetime.fromisoformat(timestamp)).total_seconds()
    return np.exp(-time_difference / decay_constant)  # Exponential decay

def compute_temporal_relevance(node):
    """Compute relevance based on timestamp and similarity."""
    timestamp = knowledge_graph[node]["timestamp"]
    similarity = compute_similarity(agent.current_embedding, knowledge_graph[node]["embedding"])
    return temporal_decay_function(timestamp) * similarity
```

---

### **4. Consolidation via Synthesis of New Nodes**
Agents synthesize new nodes during replay to consolidate information from traversed paths. Synthesized nodes represent integrated memories (engram-like structures) and are added back into the global graph with links to contributing nodes.

```python
def synthesize_node(agent):
    """Create a new consolidated node based on traversed paths."""
    contents = [agent.local_graph[node]["contents"] for node in agent.local_graph]
    summary = f"Synthesized Memory: {' '.join(contents)}"
    
    new_node_name = f"synthesized_{id(agent)}"
    knowledge_graph[new_node_name] = {
        "contents": summary,
        "embedding": generate_embedding(summary),
        "neighbors": list(agent.local_graph.keys()),
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    }
```

---

### **5. Dynamic Navigation with Preconfigured Trajectories**
Preconfigured trajectories analogous to hippocampal place cell sequences are used to guide navigation. Trajectories are dynamically updated based on input from replay events and POMDP-based policies.

```python
def navigation_policy(agent):
    """Determine next node based on preconfigured trajectories."""
    current_node = agent.current_node
    neighbors = knowledge_graph[current_node]["neighbors"]
    
    # Prioritize unvisited or temporally relevant neighbors
    next_node = max(neighbors, key=lambda n: compute_temporal_relevance(n))
    return next_node

# Update agent's trajectory dynamically during exploration
agent.current_trajectory.append(navigation_policy(agent))
```

---

### **6. Multi-Agent Synchronization**
Synchronization between agents' local graphs and the global graph ($$ \mathcal{G} $$) is performed during replay events, simulating hippocampal-neocortical communication. Synthesized nodes are shared with the global graph and other agents.

```python
def synchronize_with_global_graph(agent):
    """Synchronize local graph with global graph."""
    for node in agent.local_graph:
        if node not in knowledge_graph:
            knowledge_graph[node] = agent.local_graph[node]
```

---

### **7. Sharp Wave-Ripple-Inspired Replay Scenarios**
Replay is triggered under specific conditions inspired by SPW-Rs:
- Awake replay is triggered during pauses in exploration.
- Compressed replay is triggered after significant events or at regular intervals.

```python
def trigger_replay(agent, condition="awake"):
    """Trigger replay based on specific conditions."""
    if condition == "awake":
        awake_replay(agent)
    elif condition == "compressed":
        compressed_replay(agent)
```

---

### **8. Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism**
Forgetting is modeled by decaying edge strengths over time unless reinforced by replay or synthesis.

```python
def decay_edges(graph):
    """Decay edge strengths across the entire graph."""
    for node, data in graph.items():
        for neighbor in data["neighbors"]:
            graph[node]["neighbors"][neighbor] *= temporal_decay_function(data["timestamp"])
```

---

## **Summary of Refinements**
This refined design incorporates neurobiological principles from György Buzsáki's work into a computational framework:
1. Replay mechanisms (awake and compressed) inspired by SPW-Rs.
2. Temporal dynamics that prioritize recent or contextually relevant information.
3. Consolidation processes that synthesize traversed paths into engram-like structures.
4. Preconfigured trajectories analogous to hippocampal place cell sequences.
5. Synchronization between local (agent) graphs and the global graph ($$ \mathcal{G} $$).
6. Adaptive forgetting through temporal decay of edge strengths.

The design models memory retrieval, consolidation, and decision-making processes akin to hippocampal function while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability for implementation in Python systems.
