hypothesis: The nested Markov blanket framework can inform trade practices by illustrating
  how local supplier and consumer relationships create ripple effects throughout the
  community, leading to more effective resource allocation and better understanding
  of consumer preferences and needs.
impact: This research can lead to the development of more effective trade practices,
  better understanding of consumer preferences and needs, and improved resource allocation
  within communities, ultimately contributing to more equitable and resilient systems.
rationale: By analyzing community behavior and interactions among entities at different
  levels, the nested Markov blanket framework provides a powerful tool for designing
  trade systems that are both equitable and resilient.
