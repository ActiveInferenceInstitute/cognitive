# Research Request: We hypothesize that [[the nested Markov blanket framework]] can inform [[trade practices]] by illustrating how [[local supplier]] and [[consumer relationships]] create [[ripple effects]] throughout [[the community]].

## Created

## Hypothesis
We hypothesize that [[the nested Markov blanket framework]] can inform [[trade practices]] by illustrating how [[local supplier]] and [[consumer relationships]] create [[ripple effects]] throughout [[the community]].

## Context and Rationale
[[The nested Markov blanket framework]] provides [[a powerful tool]] for analyzing [[community behavior]] and [[resource allocation]], which can guide [[our empirical research]] and help [[design]] [[trade systems]] that are both equitable and resilient.

## Expected Impact
[[This research]] has [[the potential]] to improve [[trade practices]], ensuring they are equitable and resilient, and ultimately benefiting [[the community]] by reducing [[ripple effects]] and improving [[consumer preferences]] and needs.
