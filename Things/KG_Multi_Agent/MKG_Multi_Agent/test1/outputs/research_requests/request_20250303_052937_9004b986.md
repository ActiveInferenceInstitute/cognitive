hypothesis: This project aims to investigate the relationship between community values,
  consumer behavior, and energy consumption patterns in order to develop a more effective
  Energy Management System that prioritizes renewable energy sources and reinforces
  sustainability and community well-being.
impact: This research has the potential to improve energy management systems, enhance
  sustainability, and promote community well-being by providing a more nuanced understanding
  of how energy dynamics link with trade practices.
rationale: By understanding what the community values most, we can tailor our energy
  solutions to meet those specific demands, ultimately streamlining operations and
  reinforcing commitment to sustainability and community well-being.
