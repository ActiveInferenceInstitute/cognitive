hypothesis: Developing a framework that aligns theoretical foundations of Active Inference
  with practical applications to analyze trade dynamics and create models promoting
  sustainable practices, while also providing insights into equitable resource distribution
  and community behavior.
impact: This research aims to enrich our understanding of sustainable trade systems,
  guide actions aligning with the principles of Active Inference, and ultimately inform
  holistic and sustainable solutions
rationale: Grounding project development in the principles of Active Inference can
  help better understand trade dynamics and create more effective frameworks for equitable
  trade by considering the complexities of human behavior and community needs.
