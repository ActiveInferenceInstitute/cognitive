hypothesis: The application of Active Inference principles can guide projects towards
  more sustainable and equitable trade practices by analyzing the dynamics of human
  behavior and community needs, and developing models that promote sustainable systems.
impact: The proposed research aims to develop more effective frameworks for equitable
  trade by aligning individual expertise with the principles of Active Inference,
  fostering a collaborative environment where community voices can inform projects,
  leading to holistic and sustainable solutions.
rationale: By incorporating the diverse applications of Active Inference, researchers
  can better analyze trade dynamics and create models that not only promote sustainable
  practices but also provide insights into equitable resource distribution.
