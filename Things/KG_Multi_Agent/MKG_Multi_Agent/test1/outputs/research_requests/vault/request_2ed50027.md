# Research Request: Establishing a standardized communication protocol to ensure clear and effective information exchange among team members, ultimately enhancing the productivity and outcomes of collaborative projects.

## Expected Impact
Improved communication will lead to enhanced project outcomes, increased productivity, and a stronger team dynamic.
