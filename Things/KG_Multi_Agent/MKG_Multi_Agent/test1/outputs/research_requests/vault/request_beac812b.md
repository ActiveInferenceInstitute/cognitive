# Research Request: Identifying an ideal test subject for integrating a new team member into the research process and developing a clear method to query the knowledge graph with minimal impact on existing conversations.

## Context and Rationale
To create a seamless integration of the new team member into the conversation, while maintaining the integrity of current dynamics, by utilizing their own memory as a starting point and adapting the knowledge graph query accordingly.

## Expected Impact
The successful implementation of this method will enhance the effectiveness of the knowledge graph queries, provide valuable insights for research purposes, and establish a robust testing framework for the intermediary program.
