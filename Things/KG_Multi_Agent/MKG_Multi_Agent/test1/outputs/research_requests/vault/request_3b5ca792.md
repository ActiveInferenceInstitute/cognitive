# Research Request: The nested Markov blanket framework can inform trade practices by illustrating how local supplier and consumer relationships create ripple effects throughout the community.

## Context and Rationale
By modeling interactions among individuals and organizations, we can better understand nuances of consumer preferences and needs, guiding empirical research and design of equitable and resilient trade systems.

## Expected Impact
This framework will be invaluable in designing trade systems that are genuinely representative of diverse voices within the community, ensuring equity and resilience.
