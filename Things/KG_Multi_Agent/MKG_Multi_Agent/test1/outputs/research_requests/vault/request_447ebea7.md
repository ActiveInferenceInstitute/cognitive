# Research Request: The nested Markov blanket framework will inform the design of trade systems that are both equitable and resilient, by analyzing how different levels of community interact and incorporating community feedback into models.

## Context and Rationale
By modeling community behavior and resource allocation using the nested Markov blanket framework, we can better understand consumer preferences and needs, guide empirical research, and ensure that our approaches are genuinely representative of diverse voices within the community.

## Expected Impact
The development and implementation of trade systems based on the nested Markov blanket framework will have a positive impact on community dynamics, resource allocation, and equitable trade practices.
