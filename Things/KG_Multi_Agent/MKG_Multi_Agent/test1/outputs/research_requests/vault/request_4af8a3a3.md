# Research Request: The introduction of a test subject with their own memory will allow for the testing and evaluation of the proposed intermediary program without modifying existing team members, ensuring an ethical and seamless process.

## Context and Rationale
This approach enables researchers to gather valuable insights into the effectiveness of the knowledge graph querying system without compromising the integrity of the current dynamic, thereby validating its potential applications.

## Expected Impact
The successful implementation of this test-subject model is expected to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the MKG-based research, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of complex systems and their applications.
