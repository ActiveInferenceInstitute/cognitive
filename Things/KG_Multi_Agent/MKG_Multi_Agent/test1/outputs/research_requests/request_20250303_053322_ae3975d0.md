hypothesis: The development of sustainable trade systems that promote equitable resource
  distribution through the application of Active Inference principles, including agent-based
  modeling and simulation techniques.
impact: The proposed research aims to enrich our understanding of sustainable trade
  systems and guide actions in a way that aligns with the principles of Active Inference,
  promoting equitable resource distribution and sustainable practices.
rationale: By aligning individual expertise with the core principles of Active Inference,
  collaborative projects can be developed to analyze trade dynamics and create models
  that consider human behavior and community needs, ultimately leading to holistic
  and sustainable solutions.
