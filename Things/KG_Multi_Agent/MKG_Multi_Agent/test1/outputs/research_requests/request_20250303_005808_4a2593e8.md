# Research Request: To develop a framework for sustainable trade systems by aligning individual projects with the core principles of Active Inference, incorporating agent-based modeling and simulation techniques to visualize agent-environment interactions and test hypotheses regarding community behavior and resource distribution.

## Created
2025-03-03 00:58:08

## Context and Rationale
The interdisciplinary nature of Active Inference provides a solid scientific foundation for analyzing trade dynamics and promoting equitable resource distribution. By grounding our project development in these key design principles, we can create models that not only promote sustainable practices but also provide insights into the impacts of our decisions on communities.

## Expected Impact
This research aims to contribute to the development of holistic and sustainable solutions by fostering a collaborative environment where community voices inform projects and aligning individual expertise with scientific reasoning, ultimately enriching our understanding of trade systems and guiding actions in line with Active Inference principles.
