# Research Request: [[The nested Markov blanket framework]] can inform [[trade practices]] by illustrating how [[local supplier]] and [[consumer relationships]] create [[ripple effects]] throughout [[the community]].

## Created

## Hypothesis
[[The nested Markov blanket framework]] can inform [[trade practices]] by illustrating how [[local supplier]] and [[consumer relationships]] create [[ripple effects]] throughout [[the community]].

## Context and Rationale
By [[modeling interactions]] among individuals, organizations, and groups, we can better understand [[consumer preferences]] and needs, guiding [[our empirical research]] and [[design]] of [[trade systems]] that are equitable and resilient.

## Expected Impact
[[This framework]] will help us [[design trade systems]] that are genuinely representative of [[diverse voices]] within [[the community]], leading to [[more equitable and resilient outcomes]].
