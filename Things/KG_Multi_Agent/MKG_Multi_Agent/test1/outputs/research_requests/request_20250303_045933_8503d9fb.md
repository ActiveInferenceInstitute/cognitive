hypothesis: Developing an iterative feedback process to improve the effectiveness
  of a knowledge graph system and enhance collaborative network dynamics.
impact: The proposed iterative feedback process should lead to a more effective collaboration
  between agents, enhance group dynamics, and facilitate collaborative learning.
rationale: The proposed system aims to gather insights from test subjects on how intuitive
  the querying process is for them and whether the results meet their research needs.
  This feedback will be used to adjust both the querying process and the knowledge
  graph structure to improve performance.

## Hypothesis
Developing an iterative feedback process to improve the effectiveness of a knowledge graph system and enhance collaborative network dynamics.

## Context and Rationale
The proposed system aims to gather insights from test subjects on how intuitive the querying process is for them and whether the results meet their research needs. This feedback will be used to adjust both the querying process and the knowledge graph structure to improve performance.

## Expected Impact
The proposed iterative feedback process should lead to a more effective collaboration between agents, enhance group dynamics, and facilitate collaborative learning.
