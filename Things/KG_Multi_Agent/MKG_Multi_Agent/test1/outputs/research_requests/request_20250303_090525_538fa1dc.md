## Hypothesis
[[The nested Markov blanket framework]] provides [[a powerful tool]] for analyzing [[community behavior]] and [[resource allocation]], [[guiding trade systems]] that are both equitable and resilient.

## Context and Rationale
By [[modeling interactions]] among individuals and organizations as having [[their own Markov blankets]] within [[the larger societal blanket]], we can better understand [[the nuances]] of [[consumer preferences]] and needs.

## Expected Impact
[[The framework]] will inform [[our empirical research]] and ensure that [[our approaches]] are genuinely representative of [[diverse voices]] within [[the community]].
