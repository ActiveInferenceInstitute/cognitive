## Hypothesis
[[The implementation]] of [[an iterative feedback process]] will enhance [[the effectiveness]] of [[the collaborative network]] by allowing for [[continuous refinement]] and adaptation to [[user interactions]].

## Context and Rationale
By incorporating [[a cyclic debriefing process]], we can gather [[valuable insights]] from [[test subjects]] and make [[data-driven adjustments]] to improve [[the querying process]] and [[knowledge graph structure]].

## Expected Impact
[[This enhanced feedback loop]] will lead to [[improved performance]], [[increased user satisfaction]], and [[more effective collaboration]] among [[team members]].
