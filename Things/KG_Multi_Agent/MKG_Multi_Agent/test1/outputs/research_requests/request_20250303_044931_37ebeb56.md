# Research Request: The introduction of a structured query system for the Markdown Knowledge Graph will improve communication efficiency and productivity among team members.

## Created
2025-03-03 04:49:31

## Context and Rationale
By using predefined verbs, maintaining a list of commonly discussed topics or keywords based on conversation history, and including optional context, the query system aims to reduce misunderstandings and facilitate clearer information retrieval.

## Expected Impact
This improved communication protocol is expected to enhance teamwork, reduce errors, and increase overall project effectiveness in the BioFirm project.
