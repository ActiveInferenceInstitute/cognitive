# Research Request: [[The nested Markov blanket framework]] will inform [[the design]] of [[trade systems]] that are both equitable and resilient, while providing [[a powerful tool]] for analyzing [[community behavior]] and [[resource allocation]].

## Created

## Hypothesis
[[The nested Markov blanket framework]] will inform [[the design]] of [[trade systems]] that are both equitable and resilient, while providing [[a powerful tool]] for analyzing [[community behavior]] and [[resource allocation]].

## Context and Rationale
By modeling [[the interactions]] among entities within [[the larger societal blanket]], we can better understand how information flows between [[different levels]] and create [[ripple effects]] throughout [[the community]].

## Expected Impact
[[This research]] will guide [[our empirical efforts]] and contribute to [[the development]] of [[a more comprehensive understanding]] of [[Active Inference]] and [[its applications]] in [[real-world trade practices]].
