hypothesis: The iterative feedback process will refine the knowledge graph structure
  and querying process to better meet research needs, ultimately enhancing the overall
  effectiveness of the collaborative network.
impact: The proposed iterative feedback process and collaborative network enhancements
  will lead to improved research outcomes, increased system effectiveness, and more
  inclusive agent dynamics.
rationale: By incorporating regular debriefings and group meetings, we can gather
  subjective user feedback, identify challenges, and adapt our methods to improve
  system performance and ensure positive contributions from new team members.
