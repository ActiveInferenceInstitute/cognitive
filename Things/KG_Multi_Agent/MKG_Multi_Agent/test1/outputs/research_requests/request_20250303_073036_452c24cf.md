## Hypothesis
[[The iterative feedback process]] will enable [[the collaborative network]] to evolve in response to [[actual user interactions]] and enhance [[its overall effectiveness]].

## Context and Rationale
[[This hypothesis]] is based on [[the assumption]] that [[continuous information exchange]] between [[the test subject]] and [[the system]] will lead to improvements in [[the querying process]] and [[knowledge graph structure]].

## Expected Impact
[[The successful implementation]] of [[this iterative feedback process]] will result in [[a more effective and collaborative network]], leading to [[improved research outcomes]] and [[enhanced user experience]].
