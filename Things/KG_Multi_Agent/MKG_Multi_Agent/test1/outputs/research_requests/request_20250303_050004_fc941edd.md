hypothesis: The nested Markov blanket framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing
  community behavior and resource allocation, with potential applications in designing
  equitable and resilient trade systems.
impact: This research has the potential to guide empirical studies and contribute
  to a deeper understanding of Active Inference and its applications in community-driven
  initiatives.
rationale: By modeling interactions among individuals and organizations within larger
  societal blankets, we can better understand how information flows between levels
  and inform trade practices.
