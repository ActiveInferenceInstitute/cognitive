hypothesis: The hypothesis is that Active Inference can be used to develop models
  and frameworks for equitable trade by analyzing the interactions between agents,
  their environments, and resource distribution within sustainable systems.
impact: This research has the potential to impact our understanding of sustainable
  trade systems by providing a scientific foundation for decision-making, ultimately
  leading to more effective and equitable solutions that promote human well-being
  and community needs.
rationale: The rationale behind this research request is to explore the application
  of Active Inference principles in promoting sustainable practices and equitable
  resource distribution in trade systems. This will involve investigating how individual
  agent behavior influences overarching system dynamics and developing frameworks
  for analyzing and modeling these interactions.
