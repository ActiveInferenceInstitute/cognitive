hypothesis: The integration of conversation data with the Markdown Knowledge Graph
  will enable the development of a structured query system that facilitates efficient
  information retrieval and knowledge management within the BioFirm.
impact: This system will enhance our ability to reference critical information, streamline
  communication processes, and strengthen our governance model by ensuring access
  to up-to-date and relevant information
rationale: By establishing a link between conversations and the NKG, we can capture
  key discussions, extract relevant tags and queries, and generate actionable steps
  for further research and development.
