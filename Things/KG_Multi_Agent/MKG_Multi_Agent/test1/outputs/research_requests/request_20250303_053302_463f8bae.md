hypothesis: This iterative feedback process will allow the knowledge graph to evolve
  in response to user interactions, enhancing its effectiveness and adaptability.
impact: The proposed iterative feedback process will lead to improved knowledge graph
  performance, enhanced agent collaboration, and more effective utilization of user
  insights.
rationale: By incorporating continuous debriefing sessions and group meetings, we
  can assess the impact of new team member contributions on individual research and
  collaborative efforts.
