hypothesis: The iterative feedback process will improve the effectiveness of the collaborative
  network by enabling continuous refinement of the knowledge graph and querying process
  based on user experiences.
impact: Improved system performance and user satisfaction through enhanced collaboration
  and knowledge sharing.
rationale: This hypothesis is based on the assumption that regular feedback loops
  will allow for ongoing adjustments to be made, leading to a more effective system.
