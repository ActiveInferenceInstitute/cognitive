## Created

## Context and Rationale
By establishing a single link between conversations and the NKG, the system will extract relevant topics as tags and generate queries based on hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of actionable knowledge.

## Expected Impact
The successful integration will enhance the BioFirm's ability to reference critical information, streamline communication, and strengthen its governance model by ensuring access to up-to-date and relevant information.
