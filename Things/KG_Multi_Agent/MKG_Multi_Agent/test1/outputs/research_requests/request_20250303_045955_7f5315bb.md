hypothesis: The integration of community needs and consumer behavior data will enhance
  the effectiveness of the Energy Management System by tailoring energy solutions
  to meet specific demands, leading to more efficient operations and reinforcement
  of commitment to sustainability and community well-being.
impact: This research aims to establish a feedback loop between local suppliers and
  the Energy Management System, gathering valuable insights into consumer preferences
  and behaviors directly from those who interact with our products, ultimately informing
  economic models and creating sustainable and equitable systems.
rationale: By understanding what the community values most, we can inform our predictive
  models in the EMS, adjust forecasts, and improve service adaptability, thus benefiting
  both energy management goals and the local economy.
