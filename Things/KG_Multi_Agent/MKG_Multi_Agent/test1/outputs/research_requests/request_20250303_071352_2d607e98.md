hypothesis: The nested Markov blanket framework can inform trade practices by illustrating
  how local supplier and consumer relationships create ripple effects throughout the
  community, guiding more equitable and resilient trade systems.
impact: This research will inform empirical studies and guide design of trade systems
  that are genuinely representative of diverse voices within the community, leading
  to more equitable and resilient outcomes.
rationale: By modeling interactions among individuals and organizations as having
  their own Markov blankets within the larger societal blanket, we can better understand
  information flows and nuances of consumer preferences and needs.

## Hypothesis
The nested Markov blanket framework can inform trade practices by illustrating how local supplier and consumer relationships create ripple effects throughout the community, guiding more equitable and resilient trade systems.

## Context and Rationale
By modeling interactions among individuals and organizations as having their own Markov blankets within the larger societal blanket, we can better understand information flows and nuances of consumer preferences and needs.

## Expected Impact
This research will inform empirical studies and guide design of trade systems that are genuinely representative of diverse voices within the community, leading to more equitable and resilient outcomes.
