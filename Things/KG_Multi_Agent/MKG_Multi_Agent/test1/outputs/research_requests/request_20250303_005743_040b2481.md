# Research Request: The proposed test-subject selection process will enable the creation of a dynamic conversation history and knowledge graph, allowing for innovative research methods and enhanced collaboration between team members.

## Created
2025-03-03 00:57:43

## Context and Rationale
By selecting a willing test subject from outside the core team, we can maintain the integrity of our current dynamic while exploring new approaches to knowledge graph querying and research collaboration.

## Expected Impact
The successful implementation of this process will lead to improved understanding of the Markdown Knowledge Graph's capabilities and the development of novel research methods, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of the system.
