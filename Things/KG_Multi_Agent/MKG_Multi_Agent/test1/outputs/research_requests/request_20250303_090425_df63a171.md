## Hypothesis
To develop [[an intermediary program]] that integrates [[a tagging system]] for keywords, facilitates [[knowledge retrieval]] through [[structured querying]], and manages [[conversation history]] to enable [[effective testing]] of [[a new team member's research skills]] while maintaining [[the integrity]] of [[our core dynamic]].

## Context and Rationale
[[The proposed program]] will enhance [[the searchability]] of [[our knowledge graph]], streamline [[the querying process]], and create [[a dynamic archive]] that can adapt over time as [[new information]] and insights are added.

## Expected Impact
[[This intermediary program]] will contribute to [[the development]] of [[innovative methods]] for [[testing]] [[research skills]], enhancing [[the depth]] of [[knowledge graph queries]], and maintaining [[the integrity]] of [[our core dynamic]] while exploring [[new approaches]].
