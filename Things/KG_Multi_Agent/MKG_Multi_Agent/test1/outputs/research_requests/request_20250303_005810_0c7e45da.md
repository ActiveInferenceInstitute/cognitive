# Research Request: We hypothesize that modeling community behavior and resource allocation using the nested Markov blanket framework will inform our trade practices by illustrating how local supplier and consumer relationships can create ripple effects throughout the community.

## Created
2025-03-03 00:58:10

## Context and Rationale
The nested Markov blanket framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing community behavior, allowing us to understand the nuances of consumer preferences and needs. This framework is essential for designing trade systems that are both equitable and resilient.

## Expected Impact
This research will have a significant impact on our understanding of community dynamics, trade practices, and resource allocation. It will guide our empirical research and help us design systems that are genuinely representative of the diverse voices within the community.
