The proposed structured query system aims to address this issue by providing a simple and intuitive way for team members to express their needs and expectations.

## Expected Impact
The expected impact of implementing this structured query system is enhanced collaboration, improved communication, and increased productivity among team members, ultimately leading to better outcomes for the BioFirm project.
