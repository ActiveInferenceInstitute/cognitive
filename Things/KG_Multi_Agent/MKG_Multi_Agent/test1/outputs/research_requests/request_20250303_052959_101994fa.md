hypothesis: The nested Markov blanket framework can inform our trade practices by
  illustrating how local supplier and consumer relationships create ripple effects
  throughout the community, guiding our empirical research and design of equitable
  and resilient trade systems.
impact: The framework will be invaluable in designing trade systems that are genuinely
  representative of diverse voices within the community, ultimately informing our
  initiatives at BioFirm.
rationale: This perspective provides a powerful tool for analyzing community behavior
  and resource allocation, enabling better understanding of consumer preferences and
  needs.
