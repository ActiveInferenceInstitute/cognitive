hypothesis: The hypothesis is to develop models that not only promote sustainable
  practices but also provide insights into equitable resource distribution by incorporating
  the diverse applications of Active Inference and understanding human behavior and
  community needs.
impact: The expected impact is to create frameworks for equitable trade that promote
  sustainable practices, provide insights into equitable resource distribution, and
  foster a more adaptive and responsive approach to community needs, ultimately enriching
  our understanding and guiding actions in line with the principles of Active Inference.
rationale: The rationale behind this research is to align individual expertise with
  the principles of Active Inference, ensuring solid scientific reasoning while remaining
  adaptable to changing circumstances, and fostering a collaborative environment where
  community voices can inform projects, leading to holistic and sustainable solutions.
