I appreciate each of you bringing this to light, especially in helping me further understand how it would benefit us to have a shared pool of knowledge from our discussions and research efforts that can be accessed by all members within our group easily and efficiently. It's wonderful seeing your enthusiasm for using the MKG in this collaborative manner as we continue exploring new ways to enhance our work together at BioFirm."
