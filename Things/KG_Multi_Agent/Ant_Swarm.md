Active Inference POMDP agents (ants) traverse a obsidian knowledge graph. The obsidian knowledge graph is converted into a dict $\mathcal{G}$ where each element i is a node containing the node's 'contents' (str), the semantic embedding vector of its contents (array), and its 'neighbors' (list of strings containing node names with whome node i has an edge).

During each simulation trial $s$ in $S$ trials, the user inputs a prompt which is taken directly or reprocessed as a hypothesis which is then linguistically and grammatically validated to be making a definitive claim or set of claims containing key ontological terms, formalized as hypothesis $h_0$, followed by having its embedding $e_0$ generated.

Similarity scores (and/or other embedding-related metrics) are used to determine the top k most similar nodes to embedding h via comparison to the similarity scores of all other nodes (or in the case of hierarchical knowledge graphs, nodes at the highest layer). This creates k agents at each of the top k nodes. Each agent k carries its hypothesis, i.e. the top k-th node with its respective contents, embedding, and neighbors. In information space, the agent k thus starts at the k-th most similar node.

Agents proceed to gather nodes as further hypotheses or evidence for their current hypothesis as follows: at each timestep t, an agent k proceeds along edges from their starting k-th top node whose embedding $e_{k,0}$ is the primary embedding of reference for agent $k$. Each gathered node is added to the agent's respective graph dict $G_k$ whose structure is the same as the original obsidian knowledge graph dict structure. Each agent therefore carries a local graph-based record G_k of their path through the global graph $\mathcal{G}$.

The agent summarizes all of the nodes they have collected, producing a new node whose contents contain an Obsidian-style summary of the collected contents with [[links]] to all nodes traversed. This synthesized node acts as the resulting hypothesis of the agent k's path through the global graph of whose nodes are considered to be hypotheses and evidence. This synthesized node itself then becomes a node in the knowledge graph whose natural language [[link]] name contains a suffixed unique "hypothesis ID" thus making its work unique and also discoverable by other agents in the global graph $G$. This synthesized node also becomes the new primary hypothesis $h_k$ of agent $k$ whose embedding $e_{k,t}$ then becomes the new primary embedding of agent $k$ to be used for semantic similarity.

Agents may be equipped with a POMDP or hybrid generative model for determining and solving navigation behavioral strategies, e.g., an observation modality which informs the agent if they are on a previously traversed node, a policy horizon for predetermining a path, preferences for more or less similar similarity scores, actions related to how far or at what level or to what degree of similarity to global graph $G$ beliefs regarding when or how to create new summary nodes.

Agents may be equipped with clone-structured cognitive graphs which act as maps of the graph they explore for additional navigation augmentation.

The described design of Active Inference POMDP agents traversing an Obsidian knowledge graph relates to **ant behavior** and **stigmergy** in several ways, drawing parallels between the decentralized, emergent problem-solving strategies of ant colonies and the computational processes of these agents.

### Key Connections to Ant Behavior

1. **Decentralized Decision-Making**:

   - Ants operate without a central controller, relying on local interactions and environmental cues, such as pheromone trails, to coordinate foraging and colony activities[1][4]. Similarly, the agents in this system act autonomously by navigating the knowledge graph based on local similarity scores (analogous to pheromone gradients) and updating their paths dynamically.

1. **Path Exploration and Optimization**:

   - Ants explore paths to food sources and optimize them over time by reinforcing successful trails with pheromones[4]. The agents mimic this by starting at nodes most similar to the user-provided hypothesis and iteratively traversing the graph to gather evidence or refine their hypotheses.

1. **Local Information Processing**:

   - Ants rely on local sensory data (e.g., immediate pheromone concentrations) rather than global knowledge of the environment[4]. Similarly, each agent uses local embeddings and neighboring nodes to make decisions, maintaining a localized subgraph ($$G_k$$) that reflects its exploration path.

### Relation to Stigmergy

1. **Indirect Communication Through Environment**:

   - Stigmergy refers to coordination through environmental modifications, such as pheromone deposition by ants[4][8]. In this design, agents leave behind synthesized summary nodes in the global graph ($$\mathcal{G}$$), which serve as "digital pheromones" for other agents. These nodes encode their findings and linkages, enabling indirect communication and collaboration.

1. **Emergent Knowledge Structures**:

   - Just as ant colonies exhibit emergent intelligence through stigmergic interactions, the agents collectively build a dynamic, evolving knowledge graph. The addition of synthesized nodes with unique hypothesis IDs fosters a self-organizing system where new insights emerge from distributed agent activity.

1. **Iterative Refinement**:

   - Stigmergic systems adapt over time as ants adjust their trails based on success rates[4]. Similarly, agents refine their hypotheses iteratively by summarizing collected nodes into new embeddings, which guide subsequent exploration.

### Active Inference Framework

The use of **Active Inference** aligns with ant foraging models that optimize actions based on minimizing free energy or expected uncertainty[1][4]. Agents employ POMDPs or generative models to determine navigation strategies, akin to how ants balance exploration and exploitation by adjusting behaviors in response to environmental stimuli.

In summary, this design mirrors ant behavior and stigmergy by leveraging decentralized decision-making, local interactions, and environmental feedback loops to enable collaborative knowledge discovery within a graph-based system.
